### **Executive Summary**
The following audit evaluates three scenarios designed to meet a **3.3 target mean**. While the mathematical optimization is complete, each scenario sends a distinct "pedagogical signal" to the student body regarding rigor, reward for excellence, and the consequences of underperformance. 

Note: All scenarios currently show a non-compliance flag for the **A/A+ bracket (10.53%)**, indicating a highly competitive top tier that may require a specific faculty justification regarding the scarcity of the highest marks.

### **Scenario 1**
*Mean: 3.3014 | Cutoffs: A(90), C(51)*

#### **Positive Features**
*   **Psychological Consistency:** Utilizing a **90-point threshold** for a solid "A" aligns with traditional student expectations of "excellence." This creates a sense of intuitive fairness and transparency in how raw effort translates to the transcript.
*   **Safety Net:** The inclusion of a "C" grade provides a granular floor. For students who significantly struggled, receiving a "C" rather than a "C+" or "B-" signals a clear need for academic intervention without the immediate "GPA-shock" of a failing grade.

#### **Anomalies**
*   **The "B+ Hump":** With **33.68%** of the class concentrated at B+, this is a "Top-Heavy Median" distribution. While it protects student GPAs, it may lead to "grade compression" where the difference between a "good" student and a "great" student feels negligible to the cohort.

### **Scenario 2**
*Mean: 3.3014 | Cutoffs: A(91), No C*

#### **Positive Features**
*   **Signals High Mastery:** Moving the "A" cutoff to **91** increases the prestige of the grade. It signals to the students that a solid "A" requires performance clearly above the "90-line" norm, which can motivate top-tier students.
*   **Simplified Bottom Tail:** By removing the "C" grade and stopping at "C+," the distribution suggests a "high-floor" environment. It signals that all students who met the minimum requirements achieved a baseline level of competency worthy of at least a C+.

#### **Anomalies**
*   **Aggressive Middle Gaps:** The jump from a B- (69) to a C+ (55) is a **14-point gap**. This creates a "valley" in the distribution. Students in the 55–68 range may feel unfairly grouped together despite a wide variance in their raw scores, which could lead to morale issues during grade reviews.

### **Scenario 3**
*Mean: 3.2979 | Cutoffs: A(91), C(51)*

#### **Positive Features**
*   **Academic Rigor Signaling:** This is the most "conservative" distribution. By sitting slightly below the 3.30 mean (3.297) and keeping the stricter 91-point "A" cutoff, it signals a high bar for excellence and a faculty commitment to avoiding grade inflation. 
*   **Balanced Range:** It retains the "C" floor from Scenario 1 while adopting the "A" rigor of Scenario 2. This represents a "Best of Both Worlds" approach regarding distribution width.

#### **Anomalies**
*   **The "A- Crowd":** Since 20% of the class is in the A- range but the "A" cutoff is higher (91), there will likely be a significant cluster of students who "just missed" the solid A. Expect a higher volume of office hour inquiries from students at the 90.0–90.9 mark seeking that extra point to cross the 91 threshold.

### **Consultant Recommendation**
*   **Choose Scenario 1** if the goal is **Student Satisfaction**: The 90-point "A" is the most defensible to a student body and feels the most "standard."
*   **Choose Scenario 3** if the goal is **Institutional Rigor**: It provides the most granular feedback to the bottom performers while maintaining a prestigious ceiling for the top performers. 

**General Observation:** In all scenarios, the **33.68% B+ cluster** is the dominant feature. Pedagogically, this suggests the exam effectively sorted the "Top 10%" but found a large portion of the class to be of relatively equal competency. If this was a foundational course, this "B+ Heavy" signal is generally well-received by law firms and clerkship recruiters.
